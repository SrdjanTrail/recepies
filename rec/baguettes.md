### How to

Mix all dry / powdered ingredients in a bowl and water and oil. Mix it up and start adding flour as needed until you get a mass of soft dough that's not sticking to your fingers.
I suggest you use a spoon to mix it as much as you can, and when it becomes too hard, switch to mixing it with your hands. After everything is mixed, leave the dough in the bowl and let it rest and rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, mix the dough again and let it rest for another 10 minutes.
After it's rested and raised back a bit, take it out of the bowl and split it into 3 - 5 pieces. Preheat the oven to 200C. You want to take those pieces that you just cut and shape them any way you want. I suggest baguette shape! After that's done sprinkle them with some more flour, make cuts on the top and put them into the oven on 200C for 20 minutes.
